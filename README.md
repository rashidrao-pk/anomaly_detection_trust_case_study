### Results
we have used two categories from MVTech dataset [Screw🔩 and Hazelnut 🌰] and results using;
1. `Screw Dataset` is uploaded <a href='https://github.com/rashidrao-pk/anomaly_detection_trust_case_study/results/imgs_screw_full.html'>here </a>
2. `Hazelnut Dataset` is uploaded <a href='https://github.com/rashidrao-pk/anomaly_detection_trust_case_study/results/imgs_hazelnut_full.html'>here </a>
